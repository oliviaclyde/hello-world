# hello-world
First GitHub repository
This is my first repository on GitHub. I am a highly-motivated, hard-working individual determined to be a backend developer! I am self-teaching, currently learning Python using Bash and Atom. I am almost through the Python Codecademy course. I am also using the book "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. In this repository I will be pushing the practice exercises I do as well as initial personal projects
