#This exercise is to write down every word and symbol (character) I have learned so far

#Ex1: A good first program
#print(" ") = Everything inside the paranthesis will print to the console, won't print without close quotes and close paranthesis
# " " or ' ' = single or double quotes defines a string

#Ex2: Comments and Pound Characters
# is an octothorpe/hash/pound sign = this comments out and will be ignored by the program

#Ex3: Numbers and Math
# Remember to add a space around your operators like this: x = 100, not x=100
# + : plus, add
# - : minus, subtract
# / : slash, divide
# * : asterisk, multiple
# ** : double asterisk, exponent
# % : percent, modulo, finds the remainder of a division problem
# < : less than
# > : greater than
# <= : less than or equals
# >= : greater than or equals
# = : equals, assigned the value on the right to the variable on the left
# == : equal to, test whether two things have the same value
# float( ) : will convert answer to floating decimal
# Writing a number like 4.0 automatically defines it as a floating point
# int( ) : will convert answer to integar
# str( ) : will convert to string

#Ex4: Variables and Names
# You can assign a string or an integar to a Variable
# variables must start with a letter and be one word or include underscore_, can have numbers - just not first character

#Ex5: More Variables and Printing
# Variables can be embedded inside strings using { }
# This requires using f before double quote and { } to tell the program to put the variables inside the string
# Example: f"Hello {some_variable}."
